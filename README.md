The motion for two oscillators coupled by three springs is modelled. &nbsp; The CSS is written to create a direct reduction in size of the webpage components as the window size is reduced. &nbsp;  (This is in contrast to repository 'Oscillators-CSS-Resizing', where a reduction in browser size may create both resizing and restructuring of the page's items and components.) &nbsp; The canvas animation continues to play when the window is resized. &nbsp; To begin, run Oscillator.html from a directory that contains all files.

June 2017: Animation was apparently no longer smooth in Chrome. &nbsp; Reducing 'ratioHeight' to 0.075 appears to have rectified this problem. &nbsp; (This problem could also be rectified by reducing the browser's window size.)
